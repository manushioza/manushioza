Hi there! 👋

Nice to virtually meet you 💻! My name is Manushi (she/her). I am currently in my 3rd year of Computer Engineering @ Ryerson University 🏫. In my spare time, I like to read books 📚 and create digital art 🎨.

These days I am:
- Researching tools 🔍 my team can use to enhance vehicle and software User Experience as UX Specialist @ Helium Aero
- Finding ways to automate internal processes 🔁 as a T&O Automation Coordinator @ TOHacks

I am currently looking for a 4 month Summer 2021 internship. [Let's keep the conversation going!](mailto:manushi.oza@ryerson.ca)
