Hi there! 

Nice to virtually meet you! My name is Manushi (she/her). I am currently in my 4th year of Computer Engineering @ Ryerson University. I am an avaid F1 fan and in my spare time I like to read books and spend time outdoors

These days I am:
- Researching tools my team can use to enhance vehicle and software User Experience as UX Specialist @ Helium Aero
- Finding ways to automate internal processes as a T&O Automation Coordinator @ TOHacks

I am currently looking for a Full-time SWE role starting May 2023. [Let's keep the conversation going!](mailto:manushi.oza@ryerson.ca)
