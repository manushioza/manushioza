//about-me 

Hiya! 👋 Welcome to my little corner on the internet. I'm Manushi, a former Software Solutions Engineer @ IBM. In the past I've worked at TOHacks as a Product Developer and at Helium Aero as a User Experience Specialist. 

​
I graduated from Toronto Metropolitan University in 2023 with a B. Eng in Computer Engineering and a Minor in Physics. I enjoy reading 📖 , baking 🔪, hiking ⛰️ and building legos during my spare time and I am currently dabbling a bit in Digital Art and Sketching.

​
Have something to say? [Let's start a conversation](mailto:manushi.oza@torontomu.ca) 😄
