Hi there! 

Nice to virtually meet you! My name is Manushi (she/her). I am currently in my 3rd year of Computer Engineering @ Ryerson University. In my spare time, I like to read books  and create digital art.

These days I am:
- Researching tools my team can use to enhance vehicle and software User Experience as UX Specialist @ Helium Aero
- Finding ways to automate internal processes as a T&O Automation Coordinator @ TOHacks

I am currently looking for a 4,12 or 16 month Summer 2021 internship. [Let's keep the conversation going!](mailto:manushi.oza@ryerson.ca)
