//about-me 

Hiya! 👋 Welcome to my little corner on the internet. I'm Manushi, Solutions Engineer @ QuotaPath. In the past I've worked at ScalePad as a Solutions Engineer, IBM as a Software Support Enginee and had a few side quests at TOHacks as a Product Developer and at Helium Aero as a User Experience Specialist. 

​
I graduated from Toronto Metropolitan University in 2023 with a B. Eng in Computer Engineering and a Minor in Physics. I enjoy reading 📖 , baking 🔪, hiking ⛰️ and building legos during my spare time and I am currently dabbling a bit in Digital Art and Sketching.
